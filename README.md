# Double Pendulum Animation
Attempted to recreate the double pendulum animation from Nico's playground in the following video:

# Technology
Used p5.js for the canvas and display - tried to do a version with shaders (it works but doesnt use particularly accurate maths to update the pendulum)

# Maths
Used a simplified approximation to update the pendulums using the Euler-Lagrange equation
